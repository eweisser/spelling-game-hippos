# spelling-game-hippos
A simple hippopotamus-themed game for studying spelling. 
A game in which players, controlling a hippopotamus, chow down on watermelons to spell words.

These programs, written in Javascript, are intended to supplement books 1 and 5 of "STORIX", a Korean EFL book series for kindergarten-age students published by Yeamoonsa. The games do not include any copyrighted material; they only incorporate the target vocabulary from these books.

In the game, whole watermelons fall from the top of the screen, carrying the letters that players need to spell a set of specific vocabulary words. An image at the top of the page indicates the word that needs to be spelled; only one word is elicited at a time. The words are spelled by moving the hippo to a watermelon with the correct letter and clicking to open the hippo's mouth. The words must be spelled in the correct order to proceed, although there are no penalties for eating watermelons with the wrong letters.
